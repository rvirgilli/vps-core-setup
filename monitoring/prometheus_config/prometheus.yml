# --- Application Specific Scrape Configs ---
# This section is where you would add configurations for your applications.
# The vps-core-setup README.md explains how to do this.

# Example for an application named 'my-app' exposing metrics on port 8001:
# - job_name: 'my-app'
#   # Assuming 'my-app' is on the 'monitoring_network' Docker network
#   # and its service name in its own docker-compose.yaml is 'my_app_service_name'.
#   # If it was started with `docker run --name my-app-container ...` on the monitoring_network,
#   # you could use 'my-app-container:8001'.
#   # If using Docker Swarm or a compose file with service name 'my_app_service',
#   # Docker DNS should resolve 'my_app_service_name:8001'.
#   static_configs:
#     - targets: ['my-app-container-name-or-service-name:8001']

# Example for LOB Collector (if deployed on the same Docker host and joined to monitoring_network):
# - job_name: 'lob-collector'
#   static_configs:
#     # 'lob-collector' is the service name in its docker-compose.yaml
#     # 8001 is the default metrics port for lob-collector
#     - targets: ['lob-collector:8001']
